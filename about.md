# About Me
I am a software developer currently living in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I graduated from Dalhousie University with a Bachelor's of Computer Science in May 2016. 
I have been employed at Pelican Engineering since September 2016. I am a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. 

I have had a strong interest in game development for many years now, reading books about design and storytelling, and eventually going on to learn Computer Science to be able to program games.

Game Development
---

### Detonation Dave: The Day of Devastation
This game was made with Game Maker Studio. I did programming along with several other people, and a couple artists. 
The interesting thing about this game is that the number of enemies and enemy types dynamically change as the game goes on, and always spawn in a circle outside of the view of the player.

Files and executable for the game can be found [here.](https://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/detonation-dave-day-devastation)

### School Bus Simulator 2017
This game was made with Unity3D. I collaborated with several other people on this project as well. The player drives a bus around, collecting school children to take to school. 
However, each child collected makes driving the bus harder. The children fling themselves at the bus when it gets near them, and stick to the bus or other children already attached to the bus.

Repository can be found [here.](https://github.com/MatthewRobertMason/LD40)

Online hosting for the game can be found [here.](https://mmason.itch.io/ld40-final)

### Cult Tycoon
This game was initially made for Global Game Jam 2018. Work has continued on it since then, and has many features *mostly* implemented. It is in the old Tycoon style games, and is inspired largely by Game Dev Tycoon.
We have much of the game data being loaded from JSON, so that we can easily define new towns, companies, stations, etc. This also could allow for mods by future players. 
The core mechanics are there of buying a station in a town, hiring employees, changing priorities, etc. are all there. Basic AI is in the game too, able to perform the same functions as the player.

The game jam version can be found [here.](https://github.com/rsage28/DalGameJamFall2017) For the more recent codebase, please email me for access as the repository is currently private.

### Detonation Dave: The Day of Devastation (The remake)
I followed a tutorial on the Unreal Engine website for creating a top down shooter for this initially. I intend to go back and flesh this out into a full-fledged game once I finish the online course on Unreal Engine.

The code can be found [here.](https://github.com/rsage28/DalGameJamFall2017)

### Building Escape
This is a simple game made with Unreal Engine 4 to explore the basics of the engine and gain some familiarity with the C++ framework and how to use C++ with Blueprints.

The code can be found [here.](https://github.com/rsage28/BuildingEscape)

### Battle Tanks
This game is somewhat similar to World of Tanks in concept. The player controls a tank which is *somewhat* physics controlled, and can aim using ballistics physics to fire projectiles. 
AI controls other tanks to fight the player. Development is ongoing as I continue the course in my free time.

Repository is [here.](https://github.com/rsage28/TankBattle)

### BatBorne
This was done for Global Game Jam 2017. It is not included in the video reel because I was unable to get the project running when I pulled the repo, most likely due to being done in an older version of Unity.
We had a dark level that could be lit up using echolocation (the player character is a bat) and also a little bit by moving. All sound attracted the owl to the player, increasing its follow speed.

Repository is [here.](https://github.com/PFDrifter/ggj2017)

### Solitarius
This is a game conceptualized outside of any game jams or other events. Work was ongoing for a couple years, but has been put on hold for the time being. This is the most involved project, but was also not included
because I was unable to get the project running (also probably because of Unity versions). This game has procedural generation of the whole play map (all in one seemless scene), 2D ballistics physics for weapon aiming,
the ability to construct your own ships out of basic parts and weapons, adding system components, and loading ship data and other systems from JSON. All the movement in the game is physics based, meaning there is some 
amount of rocket science going on here too. It also has the foundations of a state-machine based AI which was in the process of being fleshed out, along with using A* pathfinding (from built-in solutions, not written by us).

Please email me for access to the repository, as it is currently private.

### Waggle
I wrote the vast majority of the code for this website by myself while working at Pelican Engineering. It was done in JavaScript using the React and Meteor frameworks. 
It is a crowdfunding website for sick and injured pets, but the site works with registered Vet Partners to insure that all raised money goes directly to the vets instead of the pet owners,
preventing unfortunate circumstances where pet owners start a crowdfunding campaign for treatment and wind up keeping all the money for themselves. 

The website is available [here.](http://waggle.org/) (This is a static HTML website, which links to the dynamic JavaScript site for donations.)

It has even [garnered some media attention](https://www.theday.com/local-news/20180724/on-new-crowdfunding-site-vets-vet-pets-so-owners-dont-sweat-over-debt) recently with its success stories.
